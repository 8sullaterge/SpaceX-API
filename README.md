Eun Sang hears from Chan Young that Chairman Kim has been hospitalized and that Tan and Secretary Yoon are on a flight out of the country to get votes from the overseas shareholders and collect signed proxy votes for Chairman Kim. Secretary Yoon reminds Tan that he needs to play the role of the sad son that his dad is sick, a little boy who is on the verge of losing his dad. Tan wonders how his dad has been able to wage this battle for the last 20 years.
 
Eun Sang goes to school and sees another body shape on the ground and this time a girl runs away holding a spray can. She voiceovers that she discovered that the body shape was drawn by a different person every day including even Rachel, Hyo Shin, Yi Seul, Myung Soo, and Young Do.
 
Young Do tells Tan to leave because he needs to wash dishes. Tan is confused and Young Do says all he can do right now is wash dishes. Young Do goes down to the kitchen to wash dishes and cuts his finger.
 
Eun Sang and her mom are sorting beans in their apartment and mom wants to send it her sister. Eun Sang asks if her sister called and find out she got a new job and cell. Eun Sang acts pissed but really wants to tell her sister that she and their mom are doing well. Mom asks if Eun Sang is really happy to be her daughter and Eun Sang is. They hug. Eun Sang gets a call from her boyfriend to head to the hospital.
 
Won and Tan arrive and Won asks if Secretary Yoon is complaining about working for him. The two boys are fishing and bickering while the adults stand off to the side to talk. He hears that Secretary Yoon wants to spend some down time with Chan Young since the exams are done. Won turns to ask how Tan did and Tan is beaming with pride and tells Chan Young to announce it.

Chan Young, Bo Na, and Yi Seul are playing cards that start with 18 years old and then having to use the cards to string together ideas of what 18 year olds would do. Chan Young wins and asks for a kiss as his prize and then turns his head at the last moment to get a lip kiss from her. Yi Seul is grossed out and her wish is for them to break up.
 
Eun Sang voiceovers that they learned that when they are 18 and things seem so raw, they cried and hurt and made mistakes and loved so freely. Tan sits down with Eun Sang and asks what he wished for when he blew out his birthday candles. Tan wishes for everyone he knows to be happy.
 
Tan walks up the stairs to his room and says that even in 10 years he will passionately walk towards her as she waits for him at the end of the road. Tan enters his room and a grown up Eun Sang stands there waiting for him. She turns around and he leans in for a kiss. Eun Sang hopes this wish can come true because only in that wish could she see everyone smiling. Tan says it will come true and he will keep wishing it.
 
Tan asks Eun Sang when she will finally treat him to that meal? Eun Sang is shocked he believed her. He wants her to cook a meal for him then, a meal every morning. Tan then asks if he just asked her to marry him? Eun Sang says no since that is just causing more trouble. She walks away and he tells her to stop letting him see her back. He wants to bicker with her and asks if she wants to go to his house?
 
Last night, i was shocked and totally delighted to be bombarded with Bona-Chanyoung kissing picsies on twitter from random ppl. They were in agreement that Krystal and MinHyuk should be the next WGM couple. lol. I would support them too.
 
That said, I also looooooved BN-CY. Their interaction was so cute and they played it so sweet, that I waited every episode for their scenes. One of the few highlights of Heirs, apart from the moms, some witty dialogues and -of course- KWB (who made a despicable charcater bearable).
 
did anyone else get a serious titanic vibe from the 10 yrs later scene. it was shoot just like that scene in titanic when she imagined what it could have been like everyone smiling happily same camera angles etc etc.
 
I felt nothing big ever happened in this drama..Except Eun Sang left momentarily and Tan goes to look for her. The rest are just little bits about other characters. Somewhat makes me feel this drama has too much cast and just 20 eps to squeeze it all in.
 
Young Do holds Eun Sang hostage in the broadcast room until Tan arrives and kicks down the door. Tan rushes in with a punch ready and this time even I think Young Do deserves to be slugged. Young Do pulls Eun Sang behind him to shield her and takes the punch from Tan.
 
Tan goes to grab a folding chair to continue beating Young Do but Eun Sang grabs him by the waist to beg him to stop and calm down. Tan holds the folding chair over his head while Young Do stares. He puts the chair down and pushes Eun Sang out so that he can talk with Young Do.
 
Eun Sang runs into Young Do at the playroom and offers him a bandaid but he just leaves. She finds the audition page for Yi Seul and Bo Na comes in to do the same thing, Awwww. Bo Na tells Eun Sang to give it Yi Seul and leaves.
 
Tan and Young Do are dragged before Ji Sook again for their damage to the broadcasting room. This time she wants to speak with their parental figures, Young Do to bring his dad while Tan is to bring Won.
 
Bo Na passes out party invitations for her make up party with Chan Young. Bo Na sees Yi Seul walking away and hands her an invitation. The two girls tearfully make up with apologies to each other. Tan walks by and grabs an invitation.
 
All of Empire Group is in an uproar when a list is posted of all the personnel changes being made by Won. Secretary Yoon goes to ask Won what he is doing? Won tells Secretary Yoon to choose a side otherwise his name will be on the list. Chairman Daddy gets a call from his brother-in-law about the personnel changes.
 
Eun Sang goes inside and her manager tells her to make a delivery. She looks at the address and calls Chan Young to confirm that its the same address as the make up party. Eun Sang knows Rachel is setting her up.
 
Eun Sang delivers the replacement drinks and tells everyone that she is not new money. She is a school charity case. Young Do arrives at the party to hear this. The other students are upset and Chan Young wants to step in but Tan stops him. The kids ask how a charity case would dare to touch the engaged Kim Tan.
 
Tan steps forward and reaches behind Eun Sang to untie her apron and pull it off her. He pulls off her hairband and then ties a corsage around her waist. They stare at each other and then Tan steps even closer and kiss her gently on the forehead.
 
Yeay heirs has finally settled in with just the right speed,before was so slow.
To be honest, i dont find tan and eunsang spark as an couple, maybe because eunsang has been playing push and pull too much that i got kind of sick of it.
Im officially a fan of kang min hyuk now, i enjoy his scene with krystal more, so cute and their scenes remind me of high school drama.
Krystals acting is acceptable now and she really portrays bona nicely, i demand more bona and chanyoung scenes..
 
Half of the time I am grumbling that I hate this show. Mostly because of the overwrought cryptic but meaning-laden dialog that the characters unrealistically drop effortlessly from their pretty faces.
 
Like most of you I too want a Tan-Won duo and a Tan-Young Do duo to fight all the obstacles on their path. The growing support group,after the acceptance of Yi Seul like Myung Soo, Chan Young, Bo Na, and the rest, with leader Young Do, I guess everyone can finally enjoy a fun and carefree high school life.
 
The change in hairstyle shows how much he changed because he got out of the shower and left without his hair gel!! shocker. They do have more chemistry togerther than tan. Both men are cute. I cant wait for them to be friends. The last kiss bugged me. I wish it was a secret garden kiss. Who kisses some one on their forehead for a minute? Rachel and trash. She has done this to her 3 times already passport custom paper and the uniform, but the uniform is the only one she actually threw away. Rachel does need to be developed more.
 
The way i see it now in this story,none of the inheritors kid will made a successful businessman here. They will make their entire business collapse. They dont have inter personal skill which will chase away the client. I just hope that this story just misleading the real behaviour of successful people in Korea. There s no way they can be successful with this kind of behaviour. Except for chan young and eun sang,the rest are crap.This story is more appropriate if it was aired some 15 years ago cos it s more digestable. With new era of busines where growth of business mostly depends on new product and inventions where on earth the business marriage is that important for growth of business anymore? In this story it was shown that their business does not have any financial difficulty which definitely give high credit ratings among banks.This drama is so outdated to me. In the first few episodes, i dont really know what kind of business that jeguk is doing. Only lately I know that they are property developer. I dont digest what clothing brand rachel s family have that they are so equal to tan s family for rachel to be qualified to be chosen as tans future wife. Why does young do dad want to marry rachel s mom when his business is far stronger than rachel mom. looking at the assets that young do s and tan family i believe they are equal but rachel is not equal to any of them (it supposed to but never shown here). Rachel mom at least must equal to vera wang or chanel or above. But even tan s mom are more fashionable than her mom. Why does tan supposed to have rachel as licence when he does not need one.I dont know if this kind of life is still relevant in Korea. I hope not.Because now people or becoming more and more civilised in order to be economically successful.
